# Running the MERN stack application

This is a guide for running the MERN stack application from the GitHub repository. Before getting started, make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed on your computer.

## Clone the repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository].git

2. Navigate into the repository directory:
  cd [repository]

## Install dependencies

1. Install the server-side dependencies using npm:
  cd server
  npm install
  
2. Install the client-side dependencies using npm:
  cd client
  npm install
  
This will start the server-side application on `http://localhost:5000` and the client-side application on `http://localhost:3000`.

The MERN stack application should now be running on your local machine. You can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

If you encounter any issues, please consult the repository's [issues](https://github.com/[username]/[repository]/issues) section for troubleshooting.
